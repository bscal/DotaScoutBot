# DotaScoutBot
A Python Program that will scout dota 2 players.

*The program is in early stages of development and not all features I wanted to add are working or added*

So far you can input multiple steamids and can return the Personaname, Rank, Avg KDA of recent games, Avg Teamfight Plus Minus.

This project is not fully complete or tested. I have no put alot of effort in to making it nice and clean.

I will covert this to an executable later on when it is more complete.

# Running
Im pretty sure this is only runnable currently on Python3.

Their are no dependencies.

Run dota.py
Input the steamid of the user you would like to scout.
-update will update heroes and items data files later on but currently serves no purpose.
