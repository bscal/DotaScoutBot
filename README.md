# DotaScoutBot
A Python Program that will scout dota 2 players. Uses OpenDota API

*The program is in early stages of development and not all features I wanted to add are working or added*

So far you can input multiple steamids and can return the Personaname, Rank, Avg KDA of recent games, Avg Teamfight Plus Minus.

This project is not fully complete or tested. I have not put alot of effort in to making it nice and clean.

I will covert this to an executable later on when it is more complete.

# Running
This is only runnable on Python3 however I never tested on 2.7.

No dependencies 

Usage: python dota.py (steamid1) (steamid2)

# Updates
I am working on so you can parse a whole match or matches for a specified player.
